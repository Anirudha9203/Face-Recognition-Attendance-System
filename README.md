# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Face recognition technology is proposed for attendance management systems, offering automation through facial recognition using OpenCV. OpenCV, a robust computer vision library, is utilized to capture live video frames, detect faces, and extract facial features. Algorithms like Haar cascades or deep neural networks identify individuals from a known faces database by comparing captured faces with enrolled faces. The process involves face detection, alignment, feature extraction, and recognition, emphasizing robustness and accuracy through preprocessing and advanced models. Real-time monitoring and logging of attendance records are enabled, providing administrators efficient means to manage attendance data. The proposed system shows promising results in accuracy, speed, and usability, offering a reliable automated approach to attendance tracking based on facial biometrics. The utilization of OpenCV alongside face recognition algorithms presents a dependable solution for attendance management across various domains.
